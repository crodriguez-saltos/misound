Title: Functions to calculate mutual information between sounds

Description: The main function measures statistical dependence for all possible pairwise comparisons between spectral windows from two sounds. Statistical dependence is measured by calculating the mutual information between the power spectra in each window. The mutual information score can be normalized against the entropy of the power spectra of the reference sound, thus yielding the normalized mutual information score (NMI). Additional functions help with discretizing spectrograms
